Steps to use TaskReminder:

1. Download the source code from the code menu on the page https://github.com/bayupradika/TaskReminder and extract the files.
2. For Windows users, open the Startup Folder in the program or press Windows+R, then type shell:startup.
3. Create a new batch file or create a file with the extension (.bat), then open it using your code editor such as VSCode or Notepad++, or edit it in plain text before saving it as a batch file.
4. Add the following code: (start "" "path\to\index.html"), directing the path to where you saved the index/source code files downloaded in step 1. For example, if the files are stored in partition D and in the document folder, then: start "" "D:\document\index.html".
